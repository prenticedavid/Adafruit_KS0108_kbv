# Adafruit-style Arduino library for KS0108 displays with DIYMORE I2C Adapter.

This inherits from Adafruit_GFX libraries.
It should behave exactly like Adafruit's own Adafruit_SSD1306 I2C displays (but without SSD1306 scroll etc).

Adafruit_KS0108_kbv inherits all the methods from  
the Adafruit_GFX class: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview  
and Print class: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Print
