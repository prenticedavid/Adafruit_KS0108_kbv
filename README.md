# Adafruit-style Arduino library for KS0108 displays with DIYMORE I2C Adapter.

This inherits from Adafruit_GFX libraries.
It should behave exactly like Adafruit's own Adafruit_SSD1306 I2C displays (but without SSD1306 scroll etc).

Adafruit_KS0108_kbv inherits all the methods from  
the Adafruit_GFX class: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview  
and Print class: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Print

DiyMore Adapter from https://www.diymore.cc/products/diymore-iic-i2c-twi-spi-serial-interface-expanded-board-module-port-for-arduino-uno-r3-1602-lcd-2004-lcd-12864-lcd-display

To download. click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder Adafruit_KS0108_kbv. Check that the Adafruit_KS0108_kbv folder contains Adafruit_KS0108_kbv.cpp and Adafruit_KS0108_kbv.

Place the Adafruit_KS0108_kbv library folder your arduinosketchfolder/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE

Also requires the Adafruit_GFX library for Arduino.
